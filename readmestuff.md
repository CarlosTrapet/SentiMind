## Successes

We have been able to produce an awesome product which we can be proud of. In a small amount of time using techs entirely new to us we were able to build our own machine learning bot and get it deployed to AWS.

Almost every tech we used for this project was something completely new to us. We have been able to use the knowledge we have gained during our time at Makers to produce well written quality code following best practices.

One of our major successes was our communication and ability to work as a team. We had daily stand ups and retros where we discussed how we had followed XP values and also a morale check for everyone in the group. We all felt comfortable being open about how we felt. Following these practices led to us having a fairly stress free time and also showed us the importance of soft skills in development.

We arrived out our MVP very early on and began to iterate on this, allowing our product to grow organically. At the end of the first week we felt we could have happily had a feature freeze and still had something awesome to show off. This allowed us to go down other avenues we didn't think we would have had time for, like learning how to deploy using AWS/Docker.

## Challenges

We decided to challenge ourselves and use AWS/Docker to deploy rather than something simpler like Heroku. This had a major learning curve and we ended up spending multiple days learning about the intricacies of

We had some problems training our bot with large datasets. We initially had a dataset of 1.6 million tweets we wanted to use but discovered that even a smaller dataset of 100,000 tweets was taking tens of hours to train with and quite often killing the process before it had completed. If we were to carry on with this project we would like to look into producing either a more efficient algorithm to train our bot with or a way to build on our bots training using partial datasets.

Using the free tiers of services (Twitter API, AWS) has caused some minor roadblocks for us. For example being limited in the number of tweets we can grab means we only have a small sample size to make our predictions on, and our website will slow down quite noticeably at times due to using AWS free tier services.

Learning Python has caused a few minor headaches. Although very similar to Ruby which we are familiar with, Python has its own set of idiosyncrasies we have had to navigate through. For example the way files are imported caused us some confusion early on in the project.

The way we split our Frontend and Backend was different to the usual MVC we have been using throughout the Makers Academy course. Learning a new architecture...

Trying to decide on a balance between adding features and quality.
